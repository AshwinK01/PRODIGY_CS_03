Here are some key features of the tool:
ðŸ”¹ Password Strength Assessment: The tool analyzes the given password based on multiple criteria, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. It then categorizes the password as 'Strong', 'Moderate', or 'Weak'.

ðŸ”¹ User Interaction: The program interacts with users through the console, asking them to input a password to assess its strength. It then provides an assessment and detailed feedback on how to improve the password if necessary.

ðŸ”¹ Comprehensive Criteria: The tool uses regular expressions to check for the presence of various character types, ensuring a thorough evaluation of password strength.

ðŸ”¹ Feedback Mechanism: The tool offers specific feedback on how to strengthen the password, such as suggestions to add uppercase letters, digits, or special characters, and to increase the password length.

ðŸ”¹ Practical Application: This project demonstrates the practical application of Python for cybersecurity, showcasing the ability to implement password policies and improve security practices.
